    <h1>Cassie Peele</h1>
    <p>
      I'm interested in nearly all aspects of the game development process, but my primary focus is the programming of gameplay and game mechanics. I love the satisfaction of watching multiple parts I've created work together to form a completed whole. <br><br>
      My dream job in the gamedev industry is that of an independent game developer, working either individually or in a small team. I prefer the feeling of working in a close-knit community to that of working in a large, impersonal studio. <br><br>
      Outside of school, I do minor game and webpage development, primarily for fun and experience. I have also studied the basics of multiple scripting languages (such as Python and JavaScript) on my own so that I can quickly test ideas I may have for larger projects.

      My favourite game of all time, probably because of nostalgia, is <em>Age of Empires II</em>. As a child, I spent countless hours forming medieval empires with large armies and booming economies. While the game was first released in 1999, a remastered <em>HD Edition</em> was released for modern operating systems in 2014 and has received periodic updates since then, allowing me to continue expanding my empires just as I used to.
