        <p><cite>PlatFORMER</cite> is a 3D, first-person puzzle platforming game made in Unity using C#.
          The entire game was built from scratch between May-July 2018, as a capstone project
          for Wake Tech's Simulation and Game Development program. It represents the combined
          talent and dedication of eight students.</p>
        <p><cite>PlatFORMER</cite>'s primary mechanic involves attaching platforms to walls and floors
          in order to create your own path through the world. I was one of three programmers on
          the team, and although I helped write nearly every script in the game, my primary focus
          was on game mechanics such as movement, platform placement, and object interaction.</p>

          clone that I made just to see if I could code an idle game in a day or so. A game about
          kissing and dating lots of girls sounded fun, so that's the theme I came up with.</p>
        <p>To get started, just keep hitting that kiss button. Once you're happy enough to go to
          work, try saving up for a date - maybe you'll get a girlfriend out of it. Also, the more
          in love you are, the more kisses you'll get. Collect 'em all!</p>

        <p>Left player uses W and S; right player uses Up and Down. Press Space to begin.

          a keyboard, using Tab and Space to select buttons.</p>

        <p><cite>Petting Zoo</cite> was the first game I made in Unity. It's written in UnityScript and
          runs on WebGL. The goal is to surround yourself with animals and pet as many of them as
          you can.</p>
        <p><cite>Petting Zoo</cite> is best played with a keyboard, but it has partial touchscreen
          support - there's no way to spawn new animals via touchscreen, so you're stuck petting
          just the one. Touch and drag to move around, and pinch to zoom in or out.</p>
